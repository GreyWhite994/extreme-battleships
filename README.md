# Extreme Battleships

Extreme Battleships is a Python terminal game, which uses the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users can attempt to beat the computer by finding all their battleships before the computer can locate theirs. The user can set the board size and amount of ships that each player has thereby increasing or decreasing the difficulty. The game is over when either the computer or the player finds all the opposing ships. A draw is also possible if the final ship of both players is found on the same turn.
